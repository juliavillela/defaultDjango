# custom user model:
in most cases, if an app requires login, you will want to have your own user class somewhere.
It is best to create and set user model BEFORE the first db migration. otherwise it might raise some errors that can be fixed, but i don't remember how.

in the app where you will create the user model(either a specific USERS app, or as part of another db):

*in <APP_NAME>/models.py*

    #in models.py

    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

    class User(AbstractUser):
        pass

you can edit the User class later if you want.

then *in settings.py*:

    # in settings.py

    AUTH_USER_MODEL= '<APP_NAME>.User'

# admin:
for a created model to appear in the admin panel, it must be added to the admin.py file.

    # in admin.py

    from django.contrib import admin
    from . import models as m

    admin.site.register(m.<CLASSNAME>)



# Migrations:
    > python3 manage.py makemigrations
    > python3 manage.py migrate

# create super user:
    > python3 manage.py createsuperuser

# require login wrapper:
login url can be set in the settings file.

    # in <PROJECT_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/settings.py
    # add: 
    LOGIN_URL = '/<LOGIN>'
